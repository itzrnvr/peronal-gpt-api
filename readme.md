Hey Satish,

Hope you're doing well!

I'm in the middle of testing the app and I need some serial keys to move forward. If you could send those over when you get a chance, that would be awesome.

Also, could you share the API schema with me? I'm particularly interested in the nitty-gritty details of each endpoint - what they do, what data they return, and how it's formatted.

For example:

#### METHOD: `GET` 
#### URL: `<https://endpoint here>` 
#### DESCRIPTION: 
*This endpoint spits out data for YouTube videos that we show on the home page.*

RESPONSE FORMAT: 


    { 
    	 "youtubeURL": "<URL>",
    	 "videoID": "<uuid>", 
    	 "thumbnail": "<URL>", 
    	 "videoName": "<String>" 
    }


Knowing the ins and outs of the API will really help me test things out and troubleshoot any issues.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards, Sanskar
